# Admin Dashboard Structure and Role Access

## Purpose

This dashboard is for administrative and officer roles in the Collaborative Research Management Platform. It supports proposal handling, approvals, budget control, progress inspection, requests, publications, notifications, and user governance. The platform’s documented workflow includes role-based access control, project-type-based permissions, and action-based permissions across proposal submission, evaluation, budget approval, progress inspection, termination, extension, team replacement, agreement, and publication processes. fileciteturn1file9 fileciteturn1file17 fileciteturn1file18

## 3. Access Rules for the 3-Layer Setup

### Presentation Layer

Controls what is shown in the sidebar, topbar, cards, pages, and buttons.

### Application Layer

Enforces role permissions, approval routing, escalation rules, and conditional visibility.

### Data Layer

Stores users, roles, projects, documents, reviews, budgets, notifications, and audit logs with restricted access.

### Permission Logic

The platform should not only check the user role. It should also check:

- project type
- current workflow stage
- requested action

This matches the document’s role-based access model, where permissions depend on the institutional role, the project type, and the action being performed. fileciteturn1file18

## 5. Recommended Visibility by Default

For a clean professional dashboard:

- show only the modules the role can use
- keep advanced sections collapsed by default
- use badges for pending counts
- show only the actions allowed at the current project stage
- hide restricted actions instead of disabling everything
